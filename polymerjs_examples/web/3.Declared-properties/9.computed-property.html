<!-- Polymer supports virtual properties whose values are calculated from other
properties.

To define a computed property, add it to the properties object with a  computed
key mapping to a computing function.

The computing function is not invoked until once all dependent properties are
defined (!== undefined). So each dependent properties should have a default
value defined in properties (or otherwise be initialized to a non-undefined value)
to ensure the property is computed.

            // In specific cases, it may be useful to keep an HTML attribute
            // value in sync with a property value. This may be achieved by
            // setting reflectToAttribute: true on a property in the properties
            // configuration object. This will cause any change to the property
            // to be serialized out to an attribute of the same name.

<!--Arguments to computing functions may be simple properties on the element,
as well as any of the arguments types supported by observers, including paths,
paths with wildcards, and paths to array splices.

The arguments received by the computing function match those described in
the sections referenced above.-->
