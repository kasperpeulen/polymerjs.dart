<!-- The element’s basic initialization order is:

 * created callback
 * local DOM initialized
 * ready callback
 * factoryImpl callback
 * attached callback

Note that initialization order of may vary depending on whether or not the browser
includes native support for web components. In particular, there are no guarantees
with regard to initialization timing between sibling elements or between parents
and light DOM children. You should not rely on observed timing to be identical
across browsers, except as noted below.

For a given element:

 * The created callback is always called before ready.
 * The ready callback is always called before attached.
 * The ready callback is called on any local DOM children before it’s called on
 the host element.

This means that an element’s light DOM children may be initialized before or after
the parent element, and an element’s siblings may become ready in any order.

For accessing sibling elements when an element initializes you can call async
from inside the attached callback. -->
